## WeedWorks.io
### WeedWorks - Where creativity and productivity roll into one
Weedworks is a community of artists, thinkers, engineers, doctors, innovators, and technologists that have come together to recognize our self-sovereignty by exercising our individual rights while honoring our personal responsibilities.

We aim to build and sustain open-sourced technological and social infrastructure for bonding cannabis-friendly communities into crypto-friendly ecosystems. This is the way we foresee is better to fulfill our common needs by minimizing individual costs while maximizing common value. Yes! We share the [Moloch's approach](https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/07/30/meditations-on-moloch/) to solve our society's coordination problems.

We want to start by building privacy-oriented open-sourced applications and networks where business and entertainment can smoothly flourish from physical workspaces to digital and scalable economies, own by our people for our people. 

We envision a broad self-regulated ecosystem where order and wealth are granted by no other authority than ourselves as equal peers within a network.

WeedWorks is a private cannabis friendly community empowered by its registered members to acquire, design and operates locations around the world that respect local laws while at the same time actively promoting our work philosophy and life-style.

## The Product

Freedom of consumption has achieved many advances in today’s societies. Countries like Spain are providing a jurisdictional framework where cannabis consumption can be done with a certain freedom. 

However, countries with full legalization as Uruguay require registering people in a Government database with the obvious privacy risks. We can’t allow legalization to take place at the cost of privacy and letting a government no trusted parties to know where we buy, how much we buy and how often
We want to go further and build up a **self-regulated ecosystem** on a decentralized cryptographically secured platform.

The challenges that are ahead of us can be solved with cutting edge cryptography, and professional customization and deployment.
Decentralized Identification Issuing and validation is the first step. Privacy, data sovereignty, individual and community reputation will come next so we can enable social engagement through governing a Commons Open Source Platform.


### Features
Some of the key features that the seed WeedWork community is envisioning are:

- ID & Privacy Mechanism
- Featured Tokens 
    - Token Bonding Curves for Financial Sustainability
    - Invitation Tokens
    - Subscription Tokens
    - Growth participation Tokens
<!-- *I find quite interesting using the Tsunami democratic app mechanism, one memeber can make a first preliminary onboard by scanning a QR being physicaly near but without collecting the location of users, still we would need to improe this mechanism to avoid provacy threats about users location. (if possible)*   -->
- Private Communications & Notifications.
- Governance over community spaces and other shared resources.
- Governance over and inter-association organization.

- ~~Weed tracking.~~
- ~~Weed Community economy~~

### MVP as a Genesis Governance Proposal (MVPaaGGP)

We want our first and Minimal Viable Product to be designed, developed and deployed by our specialized community members.

We have a wonderful venue in Madrid, and we want to share it with 40 product builders while placing the incentives to engage during a whole full week in Madrid this June.

### The Producthon

A Producthon is like a hackathon, but scoping a Meta-Product, or better said Ecosystem.
A one week sprint for ~10 teams for work and coordinate together on the plausible integration of components and tools that are already developed or to-be-developed during the Producthon.

We will have essentially three phases for the event:

* Design and wellcome weekend shilling
    * Arrival on fridays or saturday, up to each one that wants to participate in this session. The aim is to coordinate in micro, macro and Meta prototyping design.
    * A wellcome and relax party for those hackers that are just want to shill because they know they'll have to hack hard from monday on.
* Hack daily iterations
    * Four days hacking with an  engaging with a a common frame that we call the Beacon protocol, aimed to keep coordinations among all parties.
* Co-Demo Final day
    * This is the final day in which we share demos, findings, learning and take decitions about next steps and define proper and fair rewards from the DAO.


#### Producthon Operations:

To facilitate the continuous collaborative Design while guaranteing valuable common deliverables, 
we are stewarding to a multi-disciplinary coordination comitee the responsability on scope, stablish, govern and iterate synchronous and asynchronous protocols, for the leading of the Meta-Prototype development process.

The comitee will be permissioned DAO-elected people
scoped to serve the community during the event days while making the better use of DAO resources

* Logistics: WiFi and Ethernet connections for everyone, food, drinks, DJs, snacks and whatever is demanded.
* Product Catalyzers: Design and execution of iterative Beacon social protocols and events for maximizing cooperation and synergies.
* DAO Strategy an communications: gather and share the generated value information, gathering requirements and expectations from shareholders while communicating them to teams. It would be their task also to deliver Governance proposals aimed to reward the efforts of the hacking teams. 

#### Incentives:
Depending on how much funds we'll have on the DAO for the day of the hackathon, we'll be able to offer more or less rewards for DAO participants. You can [make your tribute here](www.gototheDAO.fake) so we maximize the reward.
First thing we shall guarantee is to cover logistics, catering and organization costs, then we distribute the rewards. We are assuming there are incentices enought for people to tribute and come to participate as well 


#### Dates: 
12-13 June to 19th June
Be aware of the www.noncentralconf.com starting on the 19th.


## WeedWorksDAO

<!--
> ### Resources availables to date
> * The Club
> * Community, Tech Network & VCs
> * The purpose: Empowering individuals and communities through the creation of socio-economical systems having phisical spaces and weed as bonding elements.
> * The Strategy: Deployment and customization of ZKP enabled self-sovreignity IDs for club members and their onboarding processes; validate the need and acceptance from our community and others clubs; implement novel founding mechanisms from Token Engineering fields to guarantee the sustainability of the DAO operations and development.
e.g:
    * [ID User Stories](https://drive.google.com/file/d/10dqN8WQmCoClCb39bkNwzGUsO4wqxh00/view?usp=sharing)
    * [Insurance User Stories](https://drive.google.com/file/d/10gXg4zD-BLG2LcqDl85sPIZpi9-NuM_N/view?usp=sharing) -->
WeedWorksDAO is a decentrilized funding innitiative originally aimed to deliver the Producthon event while envisioned to build a whole socio-economic ecosystem, having the weed as the first of many community bonding elements.

### Onboarding Alliances WeedWorkDAO members

Shareholders will be friends and associates of WeedWors. DAO contributors or not, digital nomads or not, we want shareholders we trust that gathers together eventually or every day in the physical and/or cyberspace that WeedWorks does offer.

So basically, everyone that wants to be around should offer a tribute, even if it's just a gesture, even though to make this a reality, we would be needing more than just a gesture.  


### Founding and Sustainability
Since we want to fund a meaningful and long-term OpenSource Product Development initiative, we are delighted to have worthy and trustworthy friends that will help us to make this project economically feasible in the short term via a MolochDAO tribute system. We are actually expecting 4 or 5 order DAI tributes.

While for the mid & long term sustainability we'll be deploying novel criptoeconomic mechanism design tools and stacks brought by amazing projects such as [cadCAD](https://github.com/BlockScience/cadCAD) and [CommonsStack](www.commonsstack.org).

### WeedWorksDAO: All-in with Moloch... for the momment
Among the different DAO tools and design paradigms in the space, due to its simplicity and flexibility, we have chosen **MolochDAO** as the proper paradigm for our organization as we find this tool as the best to guarantee coordination for gathering and managing funds to fund a common cause while granting the right to disconsent and ragequit in case of miss-alignment among shareholders
Specifically, MolochDAO v.2 allows multi-token vaulting so we have more and diverse kinds of value backing-up our shares, and guild kicks so we can protect ourselves from non-trustworthy members.
This will also allow the DAO to lead itselfs towards all plausible paths, from funding public open-source community purposed SW to commonsly owned tokenized Real State as far as we can we can wrap it into an appropiate legal framework.

### The Tribute
Beyond the initial distribution agreed from the seed community, we are suggesting a tribute of **10 kDAI per 100 shares**, of course we are going to accept lower tributes in exchange for lower shares, but this cases shall come with a proper motivation.
